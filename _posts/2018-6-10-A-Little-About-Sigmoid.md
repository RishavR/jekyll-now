title: A Little About Sigmoid!  
---


# What is this blog all about? 

Sigmoid is a **blog** intended to elaborate on the stories of how a **newbie hack with no formal experience** starts out exploring the wonderful world of [Machine Learning](https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/norman-psychopath-ai-bias-mit-artificial-intelligence-reddit-a8389011.html). I intend to post about my experiences and the projects I'm working on!

# Why keep the name Sigmod? 

**Sigmoid** is a mathematical function that has a characteristic "S" sort of a shape. **It looks pretty dope.** In machine learning, a [Support Vector Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8D5YL6cOSE) uses several kernels to transform its myriad set of data points into a more workable form - ie. **Higher Dimentional Spaces**, with a hope that in higher dimentional spaces, the **datapoints would become more distinct and seperable** (2D is kind of a bitch to work with). The sigmoid kernel was inspired from Neural Networks and can be used to localize data in a [-1,1] n-dimensional range along that "S" sort of curve.

**Overall, in sigmoid, the hyperplane looks really cool and curvy and thus it's the name of this blog! So Welcome!**
